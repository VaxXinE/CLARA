# Integration Observability and Health

> *"Defines implementation plan for integration logs, health checks, metrics, status, delivery timelines, and admin diagnostics."*

---

# Purpose

Defines implementation plan for integration logs, health checks, metrics, status, delivery timelines, and admin diagnostics.

---

# Execution Problem

Integrations are hard to operate when failures are invisible or logs are unsafe.

---

# Engineering Decision

## Decision

CLARA should expose integration health and safe diagnostics to admins and developers without leaking secrets or sensitive raw payloads.

## Status

Accepted.

---

# Integration Implementation Rule

Every integration feature must be designed as:

```text
External Input / Output -> Provider Adapter -> Validation -> Idempotency -> Normalization -> Scoped Domain Action -> Audit / Logs / Metrics
```

Do not treat external payloads as trusted internal data.

Do not store raw secrets in normal tables.

Do not let integrations bypass tenant, workspace, permission, or entitlement boundaries.

---

# Recommended Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Provider as External Provider
    participant Gateway as Integration Gateway
    participant Verify as Auth/Signature Verify
    participant Adapter as Provider Adapter
    participant Queue as Queue/Worker
    participant Domain as CLARA Domain Module
    participant Audit as Audit Logger
    participant Health as Integration Health

    Provider->>Gateway: Sends event/webhook/API payload
    Gateway->>Verify: Verify identity/signature if available
    Verify-->>Gateway: Valid or rejected
    Gateway->>Adapter: Validate and normalize payload
    Adapter-->>Gateway: Normalized integration event
    Gateway->>Gateway: Check idempotency
    Gateway->>Queue: Enqueue safe event
    Queue->>Domain: Execute scoped domain behavior
    Domain->>Audit: Emit audit if sensitive
    Queue->>Health: Record success/failure metrics
```

# Secure-by-Design Checklist

- [ ] Provider identity is verified where possible.
- [ ] Webhook signature is verified where supported.
- [ ] Payload schema is validated.
- [ ] Payload is normalized before domain use.
- [ ] Idempotency key or external event reference is checked.
- [ ] Organization/workspace scope is resolved safely.
- [ ] Credential values are not logged or returned.
- [ ] Provider-specific logic stays inside adapter.
- [ ] Retry behavior is safe and bounded.
- [ ] Failure is recorded and diagnosable.
- [ ] Sensitive integration actions are audited.
- [ ] Rate limits are considered.
- [ ] Tests cover invalid, duplicate, and unauthorized events.

---

# Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Implementation direction is clear.
- [ ] External trust boundary is explicit.
- [ ] Credential behavior is safe.
- [ ] Idempotency behavior is defined.
- [ ] Retry/failure handling is included.
- [ ] Observability expectations are included.
- [ ] Security testing expectations are included.
- [ ] AI coding assistants can follow this safely.

# Anti-patterns

Avoid:

- Direct provider logic inside product modules.
- Trusting webhook payloads without validation.
- Ignoring signature verification.
- Processing duplicate provider events.
- Logging raw provider payloads with secrets/PII.
- Storing raw access tokens in visible config tables.
- Building many fragile integrations before one reliable channel.
- Using unofficial scraping as production-grade architecture.
- Allowing integration setup by low-privilege users.
- Hiding integration failures from admins.

# Health Signals

Track:

```text
connection status
last successful event
last failed event
webhook success rate
webhook failure rate
delivery success rate
delivery failure rate
sync lag
retry count
rate-limit events
provider error codes
```

---

# Admin Diagnostics

Admin UI should show:

```text
active/disabled/failed state
needs reauthorization
last sync time
recent safe errors
recommended action
```

Never show raw secrets or sensitive payloads.
