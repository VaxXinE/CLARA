# Book V Closure

> *"Closes Book V and explains how Engineering Execution Plan should be used during coding and release."*

---

# Purpose

Closes Book V and explains how Engineering Execution Plan should be used during coding and release.

---

# Readiness Problem

If Book V is treated as static paperwork, implementation will drift away from production-ready guidance.

---

# Handover Decision

## Decision

Book V should become the execution reference for coding CLARA MVP and should be updated when implementation decisions materially change.

## Status

Accepted.

---

# Readiness Implementation Rule

Every readiness item must be supported by evidence:

```text
Checklist Item -> Evidence -> Owner -> Status -> Risk / Limitation -> Decision
```

Do not mark readiness as complete without proof.

Do not hide known limitations.

Do not hand over production operations without owners, access, runbooks, and recovery procedures.

# Recommended Signoff Flow

```mermaid

    participant Team as Engineering Team
    participant QA as QA/Security/Ops Reviewers
    participant Owner as Product/Business Owner
    participant Handover as Handover Package

    Team->>QA: Submit readiness evidence
    QA->>QA: Validate gates and risks
    QA-->>Team: Approve or request remediation
    Team->>Owner: Present go-live recommendation
    Owner-->>Team: Approve mode or defer
    Team->>Handover: Package docs, owners, runbooks, limitations
```

# Secure-by-Design Checklist

- [ ] Authentication readiness is confirmed.
- [ ] Authorization readiness is confirmed.
- [ ] Tenant/workspace isolation readiness is confirmed.
- [ ] Data backup/restore readiness is confirmed.
- [ ] AI safety/readiness is confirmed where AI is enabled.
- [ ] Integration safety/readiness is confirmed where integrations are enabled.
- [ ] Audit readiness is confirmed.
- [ ] Logging/monitoring readiness is confirmed.
- [ ] Secrets/access ownership is confirmed.
- [ ] Known risks are documented.
- [ ] Rollback/disable path exists.
- [ ] Owners are assigned.

---

# Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Readiness criteria are clear.
- [ ] Evidence requirements are clear.
- [ ] Handover ownership is clear.
- [ ] Security and operational risks are explicit.
- [ ] Known limitations are documented.
- [ ] Go-live decision can be made from this chapter.
- [ ] AI coding assistants can follow this safely.

# Anti-patterns

Avoid:

- Calling MVP production-ready because demo works.
- Skipping security signoff under deadline pressure.
- Not testing restore from backup.
- Not assigning operational owners.
- Hiding known limitations.
- Shipping AI without review/fallback.
- Shipping integrations without idempotency and health checks.
- Shipping without audit for sensitive actions.
- Shipping without runbooks.
- Treating handover as a folder dump.

# Book V Usage After Closure

Book V should be used as:

```text
engineering execution guide
Codex/Cursor reference material
PR review reference
milestone acceptance reference
security and QA gate reference
handover reference
```

---

# Update Rule

Book V should be updated when:

```text
architecture changes
deployment flow changes
security gate changes
AI behavior changes
integration strategy changes
MVP milestone scope changes
production readiness criteria changes
```
