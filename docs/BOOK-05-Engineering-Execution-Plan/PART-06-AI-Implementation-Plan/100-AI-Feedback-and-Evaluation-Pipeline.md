# AI Feedback and Evaluation Pipeline

> *"Defines how CLARA should collect AI feedback, build evaluation datasets, run regression checks, and improve AI quality safely."*

---

# Purpose

Defines how CLARA should collect AI feedback, build evaluation datasets, run regression checks, and improve AI quality safely.

---

# Execution Problem

AI quality cannot be trusted based on demos; it needs repeatable evaluation and real-world feedback.

---

# Engineering Decision

## Decision

AI features should include lightweight user feedback and structured evaluation before expanding autonomy.

## Status

Accepted.

---

# AI Implementation Rule

Every AI feature must be designed as:

```text
User Intent -> AI Permission -> Resource Permission -> Scoped Context -> Prompt Template -> AI Gateway -> Safety Checks -> Human Review -> Audit/Feedback
```

Do not call model providers directly from UI.

Do not call model providers directly from random product services.

Do not allow AI to access data the actor cannot access.

# Recommended Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant UI as CLARA UI
    participant API as Feature API
    participant Auth as Permission Layer
    participant Ctx as Context Builder
    participant Prompt as Prompt Service
    participant Gateway as AI Gateway
    participant Safety as Safety Guardrails
    participant Audit as Audit Logger

    User->>UI: Requests AI assistance
    UI->>API: Sends AI feature request
    API->>Auth: Check AI permission and resource permission
    Auth-->>API: Allow or deny
    API->>Ctx: Build scoped/minimized context
    Ctx-->>API: Return context references/content
    API->>Prompt: Resolve prompt template version
    Prompt-->>API: Return prompt payload
    API->>Gateway: Execute model request
    Gateway-->>API: Return model output
    API->>Safety: Check output and policy
    Safety-->>API: Allow, block, or fallback
    API->>Audit: Record safe trace metadata
    API-->>UI: Return reviewable AI output
```

# Secure-by-Design Checklist

- [ ] AI feature permission is checked.
- [ ] Underlying resource permission is checked.
- [ ] Organization scope is enforced.
- [ ] Workspace scope is enforced.
- [ ] Context sources are explicit.
- [ ] Sensitive data is minimized or redacted.
- [ ] Prompt template version is recorded.
- [ ] Provider/model metadata is recorded safely.
- [ ] Output is labeled as AI-generated.
- [ ] Human review is required where customer-visible or sensitive.
- [ ] Audit event is emitted where required.
- [ ] Feedback path exists where practical.
- [ ] Cost/rate limit is considered.
- [ ] Failure fallback is safe.

---

# Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Implementation direction is clear.
- [ ] AI behavior is aligned with Book IV.
- [ ] Security boundaries are explicit.
- [ ] Audit and traceability are considered.
- [ ] Human review behavior is defined.
- [ ] Testing expectations are included.
- [ ] AI coding assistants can follow this safely.

# Anti-patterns

Avoid:

- Direct AI provider calls from frontend.
- Direct AI provider calls from random product modules.
- AI context without permission checks.
- Sending full customer history by default.
- Storing full prompts/outputs without policy.
- Auto-sending AI replies.
- Letting AI execute destructive actions without approval.
- Treating AI output as verified truth.
- Logging secrets, tokens, hidden prompts, or private context.
- Expanding autonomy before evaluation and audit exist.

# Feedback Types

Collect:

```text
thumbs up/down
edited output diff metadata
rejection reason
free-text feedback optional
safety issue report
quality issue tag
```

---

# Evaluation Dataset

Build examples for:

```text
reply draft quality
grounding correctness
unsafe content refusal
prompt injection resistance
permission boundary behavior
summary accuracy
classification consistency
```

---

# Regression Rule

Prompt/model changes should be checked against evaluation examples before rollout.
