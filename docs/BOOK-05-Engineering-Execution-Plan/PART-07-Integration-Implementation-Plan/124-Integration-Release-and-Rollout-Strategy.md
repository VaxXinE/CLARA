# Integration Release and Rollout Strategy

> *"Defines rollout plan for releasing integrations safely by provider, channel, workspace, and feature flag."*

---

# Purpose

Defines rollout plan for releasing integrations safely by provider, channel, workspace, and feature flag.

---

# Execution Problem

New integrations can fail due to provider behavior, rate limits, policy changes, or unexpected payloads.

---

# Engineering Decision

## Decision

CLARA integrations should be rolled out behind feature flags, with provider-specific monitoring, limited tenants, and rollback plans.

## Status

Accepted.

---

# Integration Implementation Rule

Every integration feature must be designed as:

```text
External Input / Output -> Provider Adapter -> Validation -> Idempotency -> Normalization -> Scoped Domain Action -> Audit / Logs / Metrics
```

Do not treat external payloads as trusted internal data.

Do not store raw secrets in normal tables.

Do not let integrations bypass tenant, workspace, permission, or entitlement boundaries.

---

# Recommended Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Provider as External Provider
    participant Gateway as Integration Gateway
    participant Verify as Auth/Signature Verify
    participant Adapter as Provider Adapter
    participant Queue as Queue/Worker
    participant Domain as CLARA Domain Module
    participant Audit as Audit Logger
    participant Health as Integration Health

    Provider->>Gateway: Sends event/webhook/API payload
    Gateway->>Verify: Verify identity/signature if available
    Verify-->>Gateway: Valid or rejected
    Gateway->>Adapter: Validate and normalize payload
    Adapter-->>Gateway: Normalized integration event
    Gateway->>Gateway: Check idempotency
    Gateway->>Queue: Enqueue safe event
    Queue->>Domain: Execute scoped domain behavior
    Domain->>Audit: Emit audit if sensitive
    Queue->>Health: Record success/failure metrics
```

# Secure-by-Design Checklist

- [ ] Provider identity is verified where possible.
- [ ] Webhook signature is verified where supported.
- [ ] Payload schema is validated.
- [ ] Payload is normalized before domain use.
- [ ] Idempotency key or external event reference is checked.
- [ ] Organization/workspace scope is resolved safely.
- [ ] Credential values are not logged or returned.
- [ ] Provider-specific logic stays inside adapter.
- [ ] Retry behavior is safe and bounded.
- [ ] Failure is recorded and diagnosable.
- [ ] Sensitive integration actions are audited.
- [ ] Rate limits are considered.
- [ ] Tests cover invalid, duplicate, and unauthorized events.

---

# Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Implementation direction is clear.
- [ ] External trust boundary is explicit.
- [ ] Credential behavior is safe.
- [ ] Idempotency behavior is defined.
- [ ] Retry/failure handling is included.
- [ ] Observability expectations are included.
- [ ] Security testing expectations are included.
- [ ] AI coding assistants can follow this safely.

---

# Anti-patterns

Avoid:

- Direct provider logic inside product modules.
- Trusting webhook payloads without validation.
- Ignoring signature verification.
- Processing duplicate provider events.
- Logging raw provider payloads with secrets/PII.
- Storing raw access tokens in visible config tables.
- Building many fragile integrations before one reliable channel.
- Using unofficial scraping as production-grade architecture.
- Allowing integration setup by low-privilege users.
- Hiding integration failures from admins.

# Rollout Strategy

Release integrations in stages:

```text
local fake provider
staging provider sandbox
internal workspace
limited beta workspace
general availability
```

---

# Feature Flag Strategy

Gate by:

```text
provider
channel type
organization
workspace
environment
role/permission
```

---

# Rollback Plan

Every integration release should define:

```text
disable flag
pause ingestion
pause outbound delivery
revoke credentials if needed
replay/reconcile strategy
admin communication
```
