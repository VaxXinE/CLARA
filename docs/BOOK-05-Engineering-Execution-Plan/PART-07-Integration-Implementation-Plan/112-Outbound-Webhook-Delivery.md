# Outbound Webhook Delivery

> *"Defines implementation plan for sending CLARA events to external systems."*

---

# Purpose

Defines implementation plan for sending CLARA events to external systems.

---

# Execution Problem

Outbound webhooks can leak sensitive data or overload external systems if payloads and delivery behavior are not governed.

---

# Engineering Decision

## Decision

Outbound webhooks should be signed, scoped, retryable, rate-limited, observable, and permission-controlled.

## Status

Accepted.

---

# Integration Implementation Rule

Every integration feature must be designed as:

```text
External Input / Output -> Provider Adapter -> Validation -> Idempotency -> Normalization -> Scoped Domain Action -> Audit / Logs / Metrics
```

Do not treat external payloads as trusted internal data.

Do not store raw secrets in normal tables.

Do not let integrations bypass tenant, workspace, permission, or entitlement boundaries.

# Recommended Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Provider as External Provider
    participant Gateway as Integration Gateway
    participant Verify as Auth/Signature Verify
    participant Adapter as Provider Adapter
    participant Queue as Queue/Worker
    participant Domain as CLARA Domain Module
    participant Audit as Audit Logger
    participant Health as Integration Health

    Provider->>Gateway: Sends event/webhook/API payload
    Gateway->>Verify: Verify identity/signature if available
    Verify-->>Gateway: Valid or rejected
    Gateway->>Adapter: Validate and normalize payload
    Adapter-->>Gateway: Normalized integration event
    Gateway->>Gateway: Check idempotency
    Gateway->>Queue: Enqueue safe event
    Queue->>Domain: Execute scoped domain behavior
    Domain->>Audit: Emit audit if sensitive
    Queue->>Health: Record success/failure metrics
```

# Secure-by-Design Checklist

- [ ] Provider identity is verified where possible.
- [ ] Webhook signature is verified where supported.
- [ ] Payload schema is validated.
- [ ] Payload is normalized before domain use.
- [ ] Idempotency key or external event reference is checked.
- [ ] Organization/workspace scope is resolved safely.
- [ ] Credential values are not logged or returned.
- [ ] Provider-specific logic stays inside adapter.
- [ ] Retry behavior is safe and bounded.
- [ ] Failure is recorded and diagnosable.
- [ ] Sensitive integration actions are audited.
- [ ] Rate limits are considered.
- [ ] Tests cover invalid, duplicate, and unauthorized events.

---

# Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Implementation direction is clear.
- [ ] External trust boundary is explicit.
- [ ] Credential behavior is safe.
- [ ] Idempotency behavior is defined.
- [ ] Retry/failure handling is included.
- [ ] Observability expectations are included.
- [ ] Security testing expectations are included.
- [ ] AI coding assistants can follow this safely.

# Anti-patterns

Avoid:

- Direct provider logic inside product modules.
- Trusting webhook payloads without validation.
- Ignoring signature verification.
- Processing duplicate provider events.
- Logging raw provider payloads with secrets/PII.
- Storing raw access tokens in visible config tables.
- Building many fragile integrations before one reliable channel.
- Using unofficial scraping as production-grade architecture.
- Allowing integration setup by low-privilege users.
- Hiding integration failures from admins.

# Outbound Webhook Delivery Steps

```text
1. Domain event occurs
2. Resolve webhook subscriptions
3. Build scoped/minimized payload
4. Sign payload
5. Enqueue delivery
6. Send with timeout
7. Retry if safe
8. Record delivery attempt
9. Expose safe delivery status
```

---

# Payload Minimization

Outbound payloads should include only data needed by the subscriber.

Avoid sending full customer or message payloads by default.
