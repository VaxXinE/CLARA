# CI Quality Gates

> *"Defines the minimum automated checks required before code can merge."*

---

# Purpose

Defines the minimum automated checks required before code can merge.

---

# Execution Problem

Without CI gates, broken or insecure code reaches main branch and slows the team down.

---

# Engineering Decision

## Decision

CLARA CI should enforce formatting, linting, type checks, tests, build checks, dependency scanning, and security checks where practical.

## Status

Accepted.

## Expected Output

A CI quality gate baseline for CLARA development.

---

# Context

This chapter supports the Book V execution strategy.

It exists to make sure CLARA implementation work is:

- Traceable to documentation.
- Easy to review.
- Safe for production.
- Friendly to AI coding assistants.
- Secure by default.
- Consistent across backend, frontend, database, AI, integrations, and DevOps.

# Practical Rules

- Every non-trivial change must be linked to a documented task.
- Every feature task should reference the relevant Book IV domain.
- Every implementation task should reference the relevant Book V plan.
- Every protected backend action must include authorization checks.
- Every tenant-scoped record must include organization scope.
- Every workspace-scoped record must include workspace scope.
- Every AI-generated change must be reviewed by a human.
- Every PR must be small enough to review meaningfully.
- Every secrets/config change must avoid exposing sensitive values.
- Every docs-affecting implementation must update documentation.

# Secure-by-Design Requirements

| Area | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Repository | Secrets must not be committed |
| Branches | Main branch must be protected |
| Pull Requests | Security-sensitive changes require careful review |
| CI | Tests and checks must run before merge |
| Dependencies | Lockfiles must be committed and reviewed |
| AI Coding | AI output must be reviewed before merge |
| Docs | Documentation must not contain real credentials |
| Configuration | `.env.example` must use fake safe placeholders |

# Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The workflow is understandable by junior and senior engineers.
- [ ] The workflow is usable with AI coding assistants.
- [ ] The workflow protects main branch quality.
- [ ] The workflow supports documentation-first development.
- [ ] The workflow includes security expectations.
- [ ] The workflow prevents obvious production-risk shortcuts.
- [ ] The workflow prepares the next implementation part.

---

# Anti-patterns

Avoid:

- Coding without reading related docs.
- Creating huge PRs with unrelated changes.
- Merging code without tests.
- Keeping long-lived branches alive for weeks.
- Putting secrets in repository files.
- Letting AI coding assistants modify architecture without review.
- Adding dependencies without review.
- Updating code without updating docs.

# Minimum CI Gates

For MVP, CI should run:

```text
Install dependencies
Format check
Lint check
Type check
Unit tests
Integration tests where available
Build check
Dependency vulnerability scan where practical
Secret scanning where practical
```

---

# Merge Rule

A PR should not merge if:

- CI fails.
- Required review is missing.
- Security review is required but not completed.
- Tests are missing for protected behavior.
- Docs are missing for behavior changes.
- The PR introduces real secrets.
