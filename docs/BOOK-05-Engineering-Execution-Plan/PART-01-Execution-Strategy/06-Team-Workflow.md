# Team Workflow

> *"Defines how engineering work should move from documentation to implementation to review to release."*

---

# Purpose

Defines how engineering work should move from documentation to implementation to review to release.

---

# Execution Problem

Without a disciplined workflow, the team will ship inconsistent features, skip security validation, and make AI coding assistants produce unaligned code.

---

# Engineering Decision

## Decision

CLARA team workflow should use documentation-first development, small pull requests, code review, security review, automated tests, and release gates.

## Status

Accepted.

## Expected Output

A practical team workflow for human engineers and AI coding assistants.

---

# Context

Book V is built from the product-domain baseline defined in Book IV.

The engineering team must treat Book IV as the source of truth for:

- Product scope.
- Domain ownership.
- User roles.
- Permissions.
- AI behavior.
- Workflow boundaries.
- Integration boundaries.
- Audit requirements.
- MVP and future scope.

# Practical Rules

- Build in small vertical slices.
- Do not build isolated technical layers without user-visible integration.
- Do not bypass backend authorization.
- Do not create tenant-scoped records without `organization_id`.
- Do not create workspace-scoped records without `workspace_id`.
- Do not let AI features bypass normal product permissions.
- Do not store secrets in code, repository, logs, or normal database config.
- Do not add advanced features outside MVP without explicit product approval.
- Do not mark work done without tests and documentation updates.
- Do not ship high-risk features without security review.

# Secure-by-Design Requirements

Every implementation derived from this chapter must consider:

| Area | Required Behavior |
|---|---|
| Authentication | User identity must be verified before protected actions |
| Authorization | Backend must enforce role and permission checks |
| Tenant Isolation | Organization and workspace boundaries must be enforced |
| Input Validation | External and user input must be validated before processing |
| Output Safety | UI must avoid XSS and unsafe rendering |
| Secrets | Secrets must use environment variables or secret manager |
| Audit | Sensitive actions must create audit events |
| Logging | Logs must avoid sensitive payloads and secrets |
| AI Safety | AI output is untrusted until reviewed |
| Testing | Unauthorized, invalid, and edge cases must be tested |

# Execution Checklist

- [ ] Related Book IV domain has been identified.
- [ ] MVP scope is clear.
- [ ] Primary user flow is clear.
- [ ] Required permissions are listed.
- [ ] Required data objects are listed.
- [ ] API behavior is known or planned.
- [ ] Database impact is known or planned.
- [ ] Security risks are documented.
- [ ] Tests are planned.
- [ ] Observability requirements are known.
- [ ] Documentation update path is known.

---

# Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The chapter gives clear implementation direction.
- [ ] The chapter can be used by engineers and AI coding assistants.
- [ ] The chapter reinforces production-minded delivery.
- [ ] The chapter includes secure-by-design expectations.
- [ ] The chapter avoids prototype-only shortcuts.
- [ ] The chapter connects back to Book IV product-domain decisions.
- [ ] The chapter prepares the next Book V part.

---

# Anti-patterns

Avoid:

- Building features only because they are exciting.
- Building AI features before permissions and context boundaries are stable.
- Building integrations before webhook validation and idempotency are planned.
- Marking UI complete without API and backend validation.
- Marking backend complete without user-visible workflow.
- Treating tests as optional.
- Treating audit logs as future-only for sensitive actions.
- Letting AI coding assistants invent behavior outside documentation.

# Recommended Team Workflow

```text
1. Pick documented domain from Book IV
2. Create issue/task from Book V plan
3. Confirm Definition of Ready
4. Implement vertical slice
5. Add tests
6. Update docs
7. Run local checks
8. Submit pull request
9. Code review
10. Security review if high-risk
11. Merge
12. Deploy to staging
13. Validate
14. Release
```

# AI Coding Assistant Workflow

AI coding assistants must be instructed to:

- Read relevant Book IV/Book V docs.
- Follow existing architecture.
- Avoid inventing product behavior.
- Keep changes small.
- Add tests.
- Preserve security boundaries.
- Ask for clarification when scope is ambiguous.
