# Ticketing Frontend Plan

> *"Defines frontend implementation plan for Ticketing and Case Management."*

---

# Purpose

Defines frontend implementation plan for Ticketing and Case Management.

---

# Execution Problem

Tickets require durable ownership and clear status; poor UI causes lost issues and support confusion.

---

# Engineering Decision

## Decision

Ticketing frontend should provide ticket list, ticket detail, status/priority/assignee controls, customer/conversation links, notes, activity, and safe workflow states.

## Status

Accepted.

---

# Frontend Implementation Rule

Every frontend feature must be designed as:

```text
Route/Page -> Permission-aware UI -> Data Fetching -> Safe Rendering -> User Action -> API Call -> Loading/Error/Success State
```

Frontend may improve usability with permission-aware visibility and disabled states.

Frontend must not be the final authorization layer.

Backend remains the source of truth for access control.

# Recommended Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant UI as Frontend UI
    participant Perm as Permission UI Helper
    participant APIClient as Typed API Client
    participant Backend as Backend API

    User->>UI: Opens page or performs action
    UI->>Perm: Check local permission/entitlement hints
    Perm-->>UI: Show, hide, disable, or explain action
    UI->>APIClient: Fetch or mutate data
    APIClient->>Backend: Send authenticated request
    Backend-->>APIClient: Return safe DTO or safe error
    APIClient-->>UI: Map response/error
    UI-->>User: Render loading, success, empty, or error state
```

# Secure-by-Design Checklist

- [ ] No secrets are exposed in frontend code.
- [ ] Backend authorization is still required.
- [ ] User-generated content is safely rendered.
- [ ] Dangerous actions use confirmation.
- [ ] AI-generated output is labeled.
- [ ] AI-generated output is editable/rejectable where customer-visible.
- [ ] Loading, empty, error, and success states are handled.
- [ ] Forms validate obvious input client-side.
- [ ] Server validation errors are displayed safely.
- [ ] Permission-denied states are safe and understandable.
- [ ] Tests cover critical user interactions.
- [ ] Accessibility basics are considered.

---

# Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Implementation direction is clear.
- [ ] UX behavior is consistent with Book IV.
- [ ] Frontend responsibilities are separated from backend responsibilities.
- [ ] Permission-aware UI is defined without replacing backend authorization.
- [ ] Testing expectations are included.
- [ ] Security and accessibility expectations are included.
- [ ] AI coding assistants can follow this chapter safely.

---

# Anti-patterns

Avoid:

- Hiding buttons and assuming that means authorization.
- Calling APIs directly from random deeply nested components.
- Rendering raw HTML from user/customer/AI content without sanitization.
- Putting API keys or secrets in frontend environment variables.
- Duplicating table/form/modal logic across modules.
- Showing generic broken UI for every error state.
- Treating AI output as normal human-written text.
- Building complex UI builders before simple workflows work.

# Ticketing Screens

MVP screens:

```text
Ticket list
Ticket detail
Create ticket
Edit status
Edit priority
Assign ticket
Ticket notes
Ticket activity
Linked customer/conversation panel
```

---

# Workflow UX Rules

- Status should be clear.
- Priority/severity should be visible.
- Assignee should be visible.
- Closed/resolved state should be distinct.
- Permission-denied edits should be disabled or hidden safely.
