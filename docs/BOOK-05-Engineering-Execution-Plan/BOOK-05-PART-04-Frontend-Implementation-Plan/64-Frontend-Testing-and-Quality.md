# Frontend Testing and Quality

> *"Defines frontend testing strategy, accessibility checks, visual quality, interaction tests, and regression prevention."*

---

# Purpose

Defines frontend testing strategy, accessibility checks, visual quality, interaction tests, and regression prevention.

---

# Execution Problem

Frontend bugs directly affect trust, productivity, and security-sensitive workflows such as replies, admin settings, and AI review.

---

# Engineering Decision

## Decision

CLARA frontend should include component tests, integration tests, critical journey tests, accessibility checks, and error-state validation.

## Status

Accepted.

---

# Frontend Implementation Rule

Every frontend feature must be designed as:

```text
Route/Page -> Permission-aware UI -> Data Fetching -> Safe Rendering -> User Action -> API Call -> Loading/Error/Success State
```

Frontend may improve usability with permission-aware visibility and disabled states.

Frontend must not be the final authorization layer.

Backend remains the source of truth for access control.

# Recommended Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant UI as Frontend UI
    participant Perm as Permission UI Helper
    participant APIClient as Typed API Client
    participant Backend as Backend API

    User->>UI: Opens page or performs action
    UI->>Perm: Check local permission/entitlement hints
    Perm-->>UI: Show, hide, disable, or explain action
    UI->>APIClient: Fetch or mutate data
    APIClient->>Backend: Send authenticated request
    Backend-->>APIClient: Return safe DTO or safe error
    APIClient-->>UI: Map response/error
    UI-->>User: Render loading, success, empty, or error state
```

# Secure-by-Design Checklist

- [ ] No secrets are exposed in frontend code.
- [ ] Backend authorization is still required.
- [ ] User-generated content is safely rendered.
- [ ] Dangerous actions use confirmation.
- [ ] AI-generated output is labeled.
- [ ] AI-generated output is editable/rejectable where customer-visible.
- [ ] Loading, empty, error, and success states are handled.
- [ ] Forms validate obvious input client-side.
- [ ] Server validation errors are displayed safely.
- [ ] Permission-denied states are safe and understandable.
- [ ] Tests cover critical user interactions.
- [ ] Accessibility basics are considered.

---

# Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Implementation direction is clear.
- [ ] UX behavior is consistent with Book IV.
- [ ] Frontend responsibilities are separated from backend responsibilities.
- [ ] Permission-aware UI is defined without replacing backend authorization.
- [ ] Testing expectations are included.
- [ ] Security and accessibility expectations are included.
- [ ] AI coding assistants can follow this chapter safely.

---

# Anti-patterns

Avoid:

- Hiding buttons and assuming that means authorization.
- Calling APIs directly from random deeply nested components.
- Rendering raw HTML from user/customer/AI content without sanitization.
- Putting API keys or secrets in frontend environment variables.
- Duplicating table/form/modal logic across modules.
- Showing generic broken UI for every error state.
- Treating AI output as normal human-written text.
- Building complex UI builders before simple workflows work.

# Frontend Test Layers

Use:

```text
Component tests
Hook tests
API client tests with mocks
Route/page interaction tests
Critical journey tests
Accessibility checks
Visual regression later if needed
```

---

# Critical Journeys to Test

- Login/session state.
- Workspace navigation.
- Customer create/search/detail.
- Conversation reply flow.
- AI draft generate/edit/send-by-human flow.
- Ticket create/status update.
- Knowledge publish/archive.
- Admin permission-denied state.
- Audit log filtering.
