# Infrastructure Baseline

> *"Defines the minimum infrastructure components needed to run CLARA safely."*

---

# Purpose

Defines the minimum infrastructure components needed to run CLARA safely.

---

# Operations Problem

Skipping infrastructure planning causes fragile production setup and hard-to-debug outages.

---

# DevOps Decision

## Decision

CLARA infrastructure should include app hosting, database, cache/queue where needed, object storage, secret handling, logging, monitoring, and backup infrastructure.

## Status

Accepted.

---

# DevOps Implementation Rule

Every production-facing change must be designed as:

```text
Build -> Test -> Package -> Configure -> Deploy -> Validate -> Monitor -> Rollback/Recover
```

Do not treat deployment as file copying.

Do not treat CI passing as proof that production is healthy.

Do not deploy features that cannot be observed, disabled, or recovered.

# Recommended Release Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Dev as Developer
    participant CI as CI Pipeline
    participant Stage as Staging
    participant Prod as Production
    participant Obs as Observability
    participant Ops as Operator

    Dev->>CI: Merge approved change
    CI->>CI: Build, test, scan
    CI->>Stage: Deploy staging artifact
    Stage->>Stage: Run migrations and smoke tests
    Stage-->>Ops: Staging validation result
    Ops->>Prod: Approve production release
    Prod->>Prod: Apply safe migration/deploy
    Prod->>Obs: Emit logs/metrics/traces
    Obs-->>Ops: Alert or healthy signal
    Ops->>Prod: Rollback/disable if needed
```

# Secure-by-Design Checklist

- [ ] Environment separation is clear.
- [ ] Secrets are environment-specific.
- [ ] Production secrets are not in code/docs/logs.
- [ ] CI gates run before merge/deploy.
- [ ] Build artifact is reproducible.
- [ ] Migrations are tested.
- [ ] Deployment has rollback or forward-fix path.
- [ ] Monitoring and alerts exist for critical paths.
- [ ] Logs are redacted.
- [ ] Backups exist and restore is tested.
- [ ] Incident response owner is clear.
- [ ] Release notes are prepared where needed.

---

# Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Deployment behavior is clear.
- [ ] Security requirements are explicit.
- [ ] Operational ownership is defined.
- [ ] Monitoring expectations are included.
- [ ] Rollback/recovery expectations are included.
- [ ] MVP and future maturity are separated.
- [ ] AI coding assistants can follow this safely.

# Anti-patterns

Avoid:

- Manual production changes without tracking.
- Same secrets across dev/staging/prod.
- Deploying untested migrations.
- Running production with debug mode.
- Logging secrets or raw sensitive payloads.
- Relying on screenshots instead of smoke tests.
- No rollback plan.
- No backup restore test.
- Alerts that nobody owns.
- Runbooks that are never updated.

# MVP Infrastructure Components

Minimum:

```text
app hosting
database
object/file storage if attachments exist
queue/cache if workers exist
secret/config system
logging sink
monitoring/metrics
backup storage
CI/CD runner
DNS/TLS
```

---

# Infrastructure Rule

Production infrastructure must be documented.

Manual clicking in dashboards is acceptable early only if recorded in runbooks and later converted to Infrastructure as Code when maturity grows.
