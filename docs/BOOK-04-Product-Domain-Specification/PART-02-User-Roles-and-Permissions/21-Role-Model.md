# Role Model

> *"Defines Clara's product role model, default roles, role assignment behavior, and role inheritance boundaries."*

---

# Purpose

Defines Clara's product role model, default roles, role assignment behavior, and role inheritance boundaries.

---

# User / Product Problem

Custom access control too early can confuse users and increase security risk. Predefined roles give safe defaults.

---

# Product Decision

## Decision

Clara MVP should use predefined roles with explicit permission sets before introducing custom roles.

## Status

Accepted.

## Reason

- Keeps user access understandable.
- Prevents accidental privilege escalation.
- Protects customer and organization data.
- Makes product behavior easier to test.
- Gives frontend, backend, and AI assistant implementation a clear permission baseline.
- Supports enterprise readiness later without overcomplicating MVP.

## Product Trade-offs

| Direction | Benefit | Trade-off |
|---|---|---|
| Predefined roles first | Faster MVP and safer defaults | Less flexibility than custom roles |
| Explicit permission keys | Easier security review | More upfront modeling |
| Scoped permissions | Stronger tenant isolation | More implementation discipline |
| Role-based UX | Easier onboarding | Must avoid treating UI as security |
| Service actors defined | Better automation auditability | Requires service identity model |

---

# Primary Users / Actors

- Organization Owner
- Admin
- Manager
- Support Agent
- Sales Operator
- Knowledge Manager
- Developer/Integrator

---

# Domain Objects

- Role
- Role Assignment
- Default Role
- Permission Set
- Membership

---

# Permission Baseline

| Permission | Meaning | Availability |
|---|---|---|
| `role:read` | Product action permission | MVP/Future based on module |
| `role:assign` | Product action permission | MVP/Future based on module |
| `role:update` | Product action permission | MVP/Future based on module |
| `membership:update` | Product action permission | MVP/Future based on module |

    participant Audit as Audit Log

    User->>UI: Attempts action
    UI->>API: Sends request with session
    API->>Auth: Validate identity
    Auth->>Auth: Evaluate permission and scope
    Auth-->>API: Allow or deny
    API->>Module: Execute protected behavior
    Module->>Audit: Record sensitive action if required
    API-->>UI: Return safe result
```

# MVP Behavior

MVP must provide predefined roles and allow Admin/Owner to assign roles to workspace members.

---

# Future Behavior

Future versions may support custom roles, role templates, approval-based assignment, and temporary privilege escalation.

---

# Product Requirements

## Functional Requirements

- Role behavior must be understandable to an Admin.
- Permission behavior must be enforceable by backend services.
- UI must reflect allowed actions without becoming the final security layer.
- Role assignment must be auditable when sensitive.
- Permission denial must produce safe, understandable user feedback.
- System/service actors must be distinguishable from human users.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Authorization checks must be deterministic.
- Permission keys must be stable.
- Access decisions must include Organization scope.
- Workspace-scoped actions must include Workspace scope.
- Sensitive access changes must be auditable.
- Permission evaluation must not depend on frontend-only state.

---

# UX Expectations

- Users should only see actions that are relevant to their role where practical.
- Denied actions should not expose sensitive resource details.
- Admin screens should explain what each role can do.
- Role assignment should clearly show scope.
- Dangerous role changes should require confirmation.
- AI-assisted actions must clearly show whether AI is suggesting or executing.

---

# Security and Privacy Considerations

- Backend must enforce all permissions.
- Frontend role checks are only usability helpers.
- Cross-tenant access must be denied by default.
- Service actors must have least privilege.
- Temporary/elevated access must expire in future enterprise model.
- Role changes should be logged.
- Permission failures should not leak whether protected resources exist.
- AI tools must inherit actor permission boundaries.

---

# Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Target actor is defined.
- [ ] Role behavior is clear.
- [ ] Relevant permissions are named.
- [ ] Organization scope is considered.
- [ ] Workspace scope is considered where applicable.
- [ ] Sensitive actions are auditable.
- [ ] MVP behavior is separated from future behavior.
- [ ] UI expectation is documented.
- [ ] Backend enforcement is required.
- [ ] AI/tool behavior follows actor permissions.

---

# Anti-patterns

Avoid:

- Giving Admin the same power as Owner without reason.
- Treating frontend visibility as final authorization.
- Creating custom roles before predefined roles are stable.
- Using vague permissions like `manage_everything`.
- Allowing service actors to run with human owner privileges.
- Letting AI tools execute actions without checking user permission.
- Returning sensitive resource details in permission-denied errors.
- Mixing Organization-scope and Workspace-scope behavior without clarity.
