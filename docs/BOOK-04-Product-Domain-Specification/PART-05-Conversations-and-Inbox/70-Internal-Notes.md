# Internal Notes

> *"Defines private team notes inside conversations."*

---

# Purpose

Defines private team notes inside conversations.

---

# User / Product Problem

Teams need to coordinate privately, but internal notes accidentally sent to customers can create serious trust and privacy issues.

---

# Product Decision

## Decision

CLARA Internal Notes should be clearly separated from customer-visible messages and permission-controlled.

## Status

Accepted.

## Reason

- Centralizes customer communication.
- Gives agents and managers a clear operational queue.
- Links conversations to Customer CRM context.
- Supports AI reply drafting with human control.
- Creates a foundation for ticketing, automation, and analytics.
- Keeps communication access scoped and auditable.

## Product Trade-offs

| Direction | Benefit | Trade-off |
|---|---|---|
| Unified inbox | Less context switching | Requires channel normalization |
| Human-reviewed AI drafts | Safer customer communication | Less automation speed |
| Workspace-scoped conversations | Stronger privacy | Cross-workspace views need explicit permission |
| Simple status model first | Faster MVP | Less advanced workflow control |
| Manual assignment first | Easier to understand | Less automation than routing engine |

    Agent->>CLARA: Reviews and sends reply
    CLARA->>Channel: Sends outbound message

# MVP Behavior

MVP must support internal notes that are visually distinct from customer-visible messages.

---

# Future Behavior

Future versions may support mentions, private notes, note templates, attachments, and note edit history.

---

# Product Requirements

## Functional Requirements

- Conversations must belong to an Organization and Workspace.
- Messages must belong to a Conversation.
- Inbound and outbound message direction must be clear.
- Internal notes must be visually and structurally separate from customer-visible messages.
- Conversation customer link must be visible where known.
- Users must be able to filter conversations by basic operational state.
- Authorized users must be able to assign, reply, and resolve.
- AI draft must require human review before send in MVP.
- Sensitive actions must be auditable.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Conversation list must be paginated.
- Message timeline must load predictably.
- Channel payloads must be normalized safely.
- Duplicate inbound messages must be prevented through idempotency.
- Message content must not be logged unsafely.
- Attachment handling must be secure if enabled.
- AI context must be scoped by permission and workspace.
- Search must not leak cross-workspace data.

---

# UX Expectations

- Users should clearly see conversation status.
- Users should clearly see customer context.
- Users should clearly see whether a message is internal or customer-visible.
- Users should clearly see if a reply is AI-generated draft.
- Users should have a safe confirmation path before sending sensitive replies where needed.
- Denied access should be explained safely.
- Conversation errors should be recoverable and understandable.

---

# Security and Privacy Considerations

- Do not expose conversations across Workspaces by default.
- Do not trust external channel payloads without validation.
- Do not send AI draft automatically in MVP.
- Do not allow reply without permission.
- Do not expose internal notes to customers.
- Do not allow attachment access without authorization.
- Do not log sensitive message content.
- Do audit reply, assignment, customer relink, status changes, and AI draft usage.

---

# Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Conversation scope is defined.
- [ ] Message behavior is defined.
- [ ] Channel behavior is defined.
- [ ] Primary users are defined.
- [ ] Permissions are named.
- [ ] MVP behavior is clear.
- [ ] Future behavior is separated from MVP.
- [ ] Privacy concerns are documented.
- [ ] Audit behavior is considered.
- [ ] AI behavior is constrained where relevant.

---

# Anti-patterns

Avoid:

- Treating all messages as the same type.
- Mixing internal notes with customer-visible replies.
- Auto-sending AI responses in MVP.
- Allowing channel payloads to create trusted records without validation.
- Showing conversations across workspace boundaries without explicit permission.
- Adding many channels before one channel workflow is reliable.
- Building SLA automation before basic assignment and status work.
- Logging full message content in unsafe logs.
